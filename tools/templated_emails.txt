Re: Sydney University IT Society (SUITS) O-Week AMP Merchandise

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Justin Ting, one of the Industry Liaisons for the Sydney University IT Society (SUITS for 2016. Our Orientation Week is coming up, where we run stalls for incoming and existing students in the IT area (computer science, software engineering, etc.) alike.

We also provide goodie bags at these events for students with sponsored, branded merchandise - I was wondering whether AMP would be interested in providing such merchandise? As our orientation week starts at the University February 22nd, these would need to arrive at the university by the 19th of February (Friday) to allow us enough time to pack/organise everything into bags.

Thank you for your time.

Kind Regards,
